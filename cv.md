## [About me]
My professional goal is to get needed knowledge to start IT carreer so I'll could work remotely and be able to spend more time with my loved ones.

I know how to use Git system.  
Also I've used different operation systems in my life such as Windows, iOS, Linux, Android and even Symbian.

You can see the example of my [Codewars' kata "Multiples of 3 or 5"](https://www.codewars.com/kata/514b92a657cdc65150000006/ "Task itself") solution below:
```javascript
function solution(number){
  if (number <= 0) {
    return 0;
  } else {
    let arr = [];
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < number; i++) {
      if (i % 3 == 0 | i % 5 == 0) {
        arr.push(i);
        continue;
      } else {
        continue;
      }
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      sum += arr[i];
    }
    return sum;
  }
}
```
