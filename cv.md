You can see the example of my [Codewars' kata "Multiples of 3 or 5"](https://www.codewars.com/kata/514b92a657cdc65150000006/ "Task itself") solution below:
```javascript
function solution(number){
  if (number <= 0) {
    return 0;
  } else {
    let arr = [];
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < number; i++) {
      if (i % 3 == 0 | i % 5 == 0) {
        arr.push(i);
        continue;
      } else {
        continue;
      }
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      sum += arr[i];
    }
    return sum;
  }
}
```
